This extension allows users to crowdsource assignment deadline data (from Moodle) to help schedule events when the most people are available. This is useful when you're running a student club and you wish to maximise the number of people that show up to your events. Users who wish to contribute the deadline data should simply install the extension and login. Whenever they visit the pages in Moodle, the extension automatically collects the deadline for that assignment and headcount for the particular course. This data is then used to build a heatmap of when most students will be unavailable.
